# Machine-Representations-in-Code
Represented different finite automata, push-down automata, and regular expressions in a variety of programming languages.
The project is split into 3 parts: 1)DFA's and NFA's using Python, 2) Regular Expression checker web application, and 3)Push-down automata using Java. The project report is also attached.
